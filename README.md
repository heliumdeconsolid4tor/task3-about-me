**I believe that being the one is challenging rather than being a zero.**

It ain't Jason Statham's, but slighly altered quote from the decent series about an introverted hacker. 

Ok, something about me: 

1. May seem loony; 
1. May seem aggressive; 
2. May be furious if witnessed injustice. 

My brief CV, in case somebody's interested: 
- [x] school_1, a background to humanitarianism; 
- [x] school_2, a foundation to life mottos; 
- [x] school_3, a reason to some lost hopes; 
- [x] famous humanitarian university, a push to realization of the way being useless; 
- [x] a couple of jobs, a reason to despise trading; 
- [x] a turning point;
- [ ] a long evolutional path - in progress. 

***Some bearded joke, my dudes:***

```JavaScript

function tellJoke() { 
    let subject = "мужик"; 
    let object = "шляпа"; 
    let action = "купил";

    let punchline = "а она ему как раз"

    let oldJoke = action + " " + subject + " " + object + ", " + punchline + "!";

    console.log(joke);
}
tellJoke();

```

Vi ses!
